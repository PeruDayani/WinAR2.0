<h3> Win AR: A safer & better way to train </h3>


<h5> Aim </h5>
<p>
As a semester long project in Industrial Engineering 185: Sports Technologies and Human Performance our team lead by Peru Dayani. 
created WinAR: an application to give atheletes access to realistic training experiences against customizable augmented reality holographic opponents.
The key problems we aimed to address were the psychological barrier of practicing against the same team and constantly running the risk of serious injury during training.

<h5> My contributions </h5>
As team lead I led the technical and non-technical development. I developed the application architecture, integrated speech recognition, animated the football drills and worked on adding spatial anchors in C# in Unity.
On the non-technical side I conducted user interviews to recieve feedback, led team meetings and conducted research to find market opportunities and competition.

<h5> Application Overview </h5>
<p>
The Android & beta iOS mobile application used the front facing camera to map an athelte's surroundings. 
The app then searches for a suitable surface to start training on using the Vuforia SDK.
Once a suitable plane group has been found the athlete can use voice commands to start select drills.
Speech recognition was developed and integrated using the Android Speech to Text plugin.
A football play model was created and animated for a select few offensive trailing drills.
Spatial anchors were added to streamline mapping surroundings and onboarding time for athelets.
